title: "Py-Tetrad and RPy-Tetrad: A New Python Interface\r with R Support for Tetrad
  Causal Search"
abstract: "We give novel Python and R interfaces for the (Java)\r Tetrad project for
  causal modeling, search, and\r estimation. The Tetrad project is a mainstay in the\r
  literature, having been under consistent development\r for over 30 years. Some of
  its algorithms are now\r classics, like PC and FCI; others are recent\r developments.
  It is increasingly the case, however,\r that researchers need to access the underlying
  Java\r code from Python or R. Existing methods for doing\r this are inadequate.
  We provide new, up-to-date\r methods using the JPype Python-Java interface and\r
  the Reticulate Python-R interface, directly solving\r these issues. With the addition
  of some simple tools\r and the provision of working examples for both\r Python and
  R, using JPype and Reticulate to\r interface Python and R with Tetrad is\r straightforward
  and intuitive."
