title: "A Computational Framework for EEG Causal Oscillatory\r Connectivity"
abstract: "Here we advance a new approach for measuring EEG\r causal oscillatory connectivity,
  capitalizing on\r recent advances in causal discovery analysis for\r skewed time
  series data and in spectral\r parameterization of time-frequency (TF) data. We\r
  first parameterize EEG TF data into separate\r oscillatory and aperiodic components.
  We then\r measure causal interactions between separated\r oscillatory data with
  the recently proposed causal\r connectivity method Greedy Adjacencies and\r Non-Gaussian
  Orientations (GANGO). We apply GANGO to\r contemporaneous time series, then we extend
  the\r GANGO method to lagged data that control for\r temporal autocorrelation. We
  apply this approach to\r EEG data acquired in the context of a clinical trial\r
  investigating noninvasive transcranial direct\r current stimulation to treat executive
  dysfunction\r following mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI). First,\r we analyze
  whole-scalp oscillatory connectivity\r patterns using community detection. Then
  we\r demonstrate that tDCS increases the effect size of\r causal theta-band oscillatory
  connections between\r prefrontal sensors and the rest of the scalp, while\r simultaneously
  decreasing causal alpha-band\r oscillatory connections between prefrontal sensors\r
  and the rest of the scalp. Improved executive\r functioning following tDCS could
  result from\r increased prefrontal causal theta oscillatory\r influence, and decreased
  prefrontal alpha-band\r causal oscillatory influence."
