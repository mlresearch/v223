title: "Structure Learning for Groups of Variables in\r Nonlinear Time-Series Data
  with\r Location-Scale Noise"
abstract: "Learning causal structures from observational data\r has recently attracted
  considerable\r attention.Although many studies have focused on\r uncovering the
  connections between scalar random\r variables,estimation algorithms for groups of\r
  variables—particularly for multiple groups of\r variables—remain scarce.This paper
  proposes a\r novel differentiable algebraic constraint that can\r be used along
  with existing continuous\r optimization-based structure-learning algorithms to\r
  learn the causal relationships among groups of\r variables.Considering the complex
  functional\r relationships among variables in real-world\r scenarios, we propose
  a structure-learning algorithm\r for nonlinear time-series data with location-scale\r
  noise.Experimental results for synthetic and\r real-world data indicate that the
  proposed group\r acyclicity constraint significantly increases the\r estimation
  accuracy for the causal relationship\r among the groups of variables and verify
  the\r effectiveness of the proposed structure-learning\r algorithm."
