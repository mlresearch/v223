title: "Linkages among the Foreign Exchange, Stock, and Bond\r Markets in Japan and
  the United States"
abstract: "While economic theory explains the linkages among\r the financial markets
  of different countries,\r empirical studies mainly verify the linkages through\r
  Granger causality, without considering latent\r variables or instantaneous effects.
  Their findings\r are inconsistent regarding the existence of causal\r linkages among
  financial markets, which might be\r attributed to differences in the focused markets,\r
  data periods, and methods applied. Our study adopts\r causal discovery methods including
  VAR-LiNGAM and\r LPCMCI with domain knowledge to explore the linkages\r among financial
  markets in Japan and the United\r States (US) for the post Covid-19 pandemic period\r
  under divergent monetary policy directions. The\r VAR-LiNGAM results reveal that
  the previous day’s US\r market influences the following day’s Japanese\r market
  for both stocks and bonds, and the bond\r markets of the previous day impact the
  following\r day’s foreign exchange (FX) market directly and the\r following day’s
  Japanese stock market\r indirectly. The LPCMCI results indicate the\r existence
  of potential latent confounders. Our\r results demonstrate that VAR-LiNGAM uniquely\r
  identifies the directed acyclic graph (DAG), and\r thus provides informative insight
  into the causal\r relationship when the assumptions are considered\r valid. Our
  study contributes to a better\r understanding of the linkages among financial\r
  markets in the analyzed data period by supporting\r the existence of linkages between
  Japan and the US\r for the same financial markets and among FX, stock,\r and bond
  markets, thus highlighting the importance\r of leveraging causal discovery methods
  in the\r financial domain."
