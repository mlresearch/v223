@InProceedings{jiang23,
  title =	 {Linkages among the Foreign Exchange, Stock, and Bond
                  Markets in Japan and the United States},
  author =	 {Jiang, Yi and Shimizu, Shohei},
  pages =	 {1-19},
  abstract =	 {While economic theory explains the linkages among
                  the financial markets of different countries,
                  empirical studies mainly verify the linkages through
                  Granger causality, without considering latent
                  variables or instantaneous effects. Their findings
                  are inconsistent regarding the existence of causal
                  linkages among financial markets, which might be
                  attributed to differences in the focused markets,
                  data periods, and methods applied. Our study adopts
                  causal discovery methods including VAR-LiNGAM and
                  LPCMCI with domain knowledge to explore the linkages
                  among financial markets in Japan and the United
                  States (US) for the post Covid-19 pandemic period
                  under divergent monetary policy directions. The
                  VAR-LiNGAM results reveal that the previous day’s US
                  market influences the following day’s Japanese
                  market for both stocks and bonds, and the bond
                  markets of the previous day impact the following
                  day’s foreign exchange (FX) market directly and the
                  following day’s Japanese stock market
                  indirectly. The LPCMCI results indicate the
                  existence of potential latent confounders. Our
                  results demonstrate that VAR-LiNGAM uniquely
                  identifies the directed acyclic graph (DAG), and
                  thus provides informative insight into the causal
                  relationship when the assumptions are considered
                  valid. Our study contributes to a better
                  understanding of the linkages among financial
                  markets in the analyzed data period by supporting
                  the existence of linkages between Japan and the US
                  for the same financial markets and among FX, stock,
                  and bond markets, thus highlighting the importance
                  of leveraging causal discovery methods in the
                  financial domain.}

                  Nonlinear Time-Series Data with
                  Location-Scale Noise},
  author =	 {Kikuchi, Genta and Shimizu, Shohei},
  pages =	 {20-39},
  abstract =	 {Learning causal structures from observational data
                  has recently attracted considerable
                  attention.Although many studies have focused on
                  uncovering the connections between scalar random
                  variables,estimation algorithms for groups of
                  variables---particularly for multiple groups of
                  variables---remain scarce.This paper proposes a
                  novel differentiable algebraic constraint that can
                  be used along with existing continuous
                  optimization-based structure-learning algorithms to
                  learn the causal relationships among groups of
                  variables.Considering the complex functional
                  relationships among variables in real-world
                  scenarios, we propose a structure-learning algorithm
                  for nonlinear time-series data with location-scale
                  noise.Experimental results for synthetic and
                  real-world data indicate that the proposed group
                  acyclicity constraint significantly increases the
                  estimation accuracy for the causal relationship
                  among the groups of variables and verify the
                  effectiveness of the proposed structure-learning
                  algorithm.}

                  with R Support for Tetrad Causal Search},
  author =	 {Ramsey, Joseph and Andrews, Bryan},
  pages =	 {40-51},
  abstract =	 {We give novel Python and R interfaces for the (Java)
                  Tetrad project for causal modeling, search, and
                  estimation. The Tetrad project is a mainstay in the
                  literature, having been under consistent development
                  for over 30 years. Some of its algorithms are now
                  classics, like PC and FCI; others are recent
                  developments. It is increasingly the case, however,
                  that researchers need to access the underlying Java
                  code from Python or R. Existing methods for doing
                  this are inadequate. We provide new, up-to-date
                  methods using the JPype Python-Java interface and
                  the Reticulate Python-R interface, directly solving
                  these issues. With the addition of some simple tools
                  and the provision of working examples for both
                  Python and R, using JPype and Reticulate to
                  interface Python and R with Tetrad is
                  straightforward and intuitive.}

                  Connectivity},
  author =	 {Rawls, Eric and Gilmore, Casey and Kummerfeld, Erich
                  and Lim, Kelvin and Nienow, Tasha},
  pages =	 {40-51},
  abstract =	 {Here we advance a new approach for measuring EEG
                  causal oscillatory connectivity, capitalizing on
                  recent advances in causal discovery analysis for
                  skewed time series data and in spectral
                  parameterization of time-frequency (TF) data. We
                  first parameterize EEG TF data into separate
                  oscillatory and aperiodic components. We then
                  measure causal interactions between separated
                  oscillatory data with the recently proposed causal
                  connectivity method Greedy Adjacencies and
                  Non-Gaussian Orientations (GANGO). We apply GANGO to
                  contemporaneous time series, then we extend the
                  GANGO method to lagged data that control for
                  temporal autocorrelation. We apply this approach to
                  EEG data acquired in the context of a clinical trial
                  investigating noninvasive transcranial direct
                  current stimulation to treat executive dysfunction
                  following mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI). First,
                  we analyze whole-scalp oscillatory connectivity
                  patterns using community detection. Then we
                  demonstrate that tDCS increases the effect size of
                  causal theta-band oscillatory connections between
                  prefrontal sensors and the rest of the scalp, while
                  simultaneously decreasing causal alpha-band
                  oscillatory connections between prefrontal sensors
                  and the rest of the scalp. Improved executive
                  functioning following tDCS could result from
                  increased prefrontal causal theta oscillatory
                  influence, and decreased prefrontal alpha-band
                  causal oscillatory influence.}
